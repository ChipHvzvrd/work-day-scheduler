# work-day-scheduler

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar (completed)
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours (completed)
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future (completed)
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event (completed)
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage (completed)
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist (yet to test)

MVP:
--ability to add an agenda to a specific time
--times turn red if current time is passed.
--Current time is displayed on top of page
--can remove and reset agenda
--agenda is saved in local storage
